Welcome! The following will describe the requirements and process on how to connect to IRIS. It may seem complex, but we hope that this overview and step by step guide will help to ease you through the process.

In the beginning we will also host sessions at https://meet.jit.si/iris and also encourage you to browse or open a new item in the discussions section. If you [send us a message](mailto:iris@inoeg.de) we can add you to the appropriate workspaces, later on we will transfer to a forum on github. If you feel like you would want to add or refine some critical information: Welcome to the community and just create a pull request.

***Make sure, your app follows the [Code of Conduct of Apps](https://github.com/iris-gateway/iris-documentation/blob/main/connect_your_app_to_IRIS/code_of_conduct_apps_for_IRIS_draft.md) for IRIS and the [DSGVO](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02016R0679-20160504)***  
We take data privacy very serious. As such the encryption needed for IRIS can be complex to implement. IRIS provides an EPS. The specs of our end point server can be found at 
https://github.com/iris-gateway/eps

And please: if you become aware about security-issues, we hope for a responsible disclosure process. Please [contact us](mailto:iris@inoeg.de).

You can find more details about the onboarding-process in the [documentation](https://github.com/iris-gateway/iris-documentation/blob/main/connect_your_app_to_IRIS/technical_details/app_onboarding.md).
