# How to connect your App to IRIS


In this document we describe how apps can be connected to the IRIS system.  


## Overview

The IRIS System consists of different actors that form trust relationships with each other based on certificates. These actors are 1) IRIS Central services 2) Contact Tracing Applications (you) and 3) Health Departments. Actors use the [IRIS endpointserver](https://github.com/iris-gateway/eps) in order to exchange messages with other actors. Each actor is registered in the public IRIS service directory alongside with its corresponding role on the IRIS system.

Please find below and overview of the IRIS system and its actors as well as the flows that are relevant for your application.

|Step|Description|
|-|-|
|1|You need to send a certificate signing request (csr) to the [IRIS rollout team](mailto:rollout@iris-gateway.de). The rollout team will provide you with a certificate in return. You need to configure your EPS to use that certificate.|
|2|The IRIS rollout team registers your app and the endpoint domain in the service direcory.|
|3|Your app pushes the locations for those it is responsible for into the central locations service. This is a frequent process and depends on the lifecycle of the locations that are managed within by app|
|4|The health authority employees can use the IRIS client (having ints own EPS) in order to search for locations.|
|5|The IRIS client connects to your app through the EPS layer and requests guest lists for a specific date and time. In order to know the endpoint IRIS internally keeps a record of which location is owned by which app. Your app returns the contact information using EPS.|

## Prerequisites

You need to open port 4444 for incoming connections. 

## Request a certificate

Generate your certificate signing request 

Please use your app name as CN (for example CN=smartmeeting). *Don't use spaces*.

    O="COSYNUS GmbH"
    ST="Europaplatz 5"
    L="64293 Darmstadt"
    C="DE"
    OU="IT"
    CN=[yourappname]
    # using less than 1024 here will result in a TLS handshake failure in Go
    # using less than 2048 will cause e.g. 'curl' to complain that the ciper is too weak
    LEN="2048"


    openssl genrsa -out "[yourappname].key" 2048;
  	openssl rsa -in "[yourappname].key" -pubout -out "[yourappname].pub";
  	openssl req -new -sha256 -key "[yourappname].key" -subj "/C=${C}/ST=${ST}/L=${L}/O=${O}/OU=${OU}/CN=${CN}" -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:[yourappname],DNS:*.[yourappname].local" -out "[yourappname].csr";

 
 
Send the .csr and your domain to [IRIS rollout team](mailto:rollout@iris-gateway.de) and get your .crt file back from us.
  	

## Install and configure EPS

The settings folder below eps-config must be copied to your own server. The files must be adapted according to this document and the comments in the respective files. The certificate issued by us and the corresponding key must be stored in the certs folder.

The settings folder is then referenced in the docker call as ``[your-local-settings-path]`` as an absolute path.

You can start a local eps with

    docker run --name iris-eps --expose 5556 --expose 4444 -p 5556:5556 -p 4444:4444 -v [your-local-settings-path]:/app/settings -e EPS_SETTINGS=settings/staging/roles/[yourapp] inoeg/eps:v0.0.4 --level trace server run
 
`[yourapp]` corresponds to the app name you chose for CN in your certificate. 

Port 4444 is mandatory for staging environment. You can change port 5556 to your needs.  

Requests will then be sent to `POST https://localhost:5556/jsonrpc` 

## Interacting with EPS

### Sending messages

Sending messages to IRIS is done with JSON-RPC. 

    {
        "method": "[destination-identifier].[methodname]", 
        "id": "1", 
        "params": {
            "param1": "test"
        }, 
        "jsonrpc": "2.0"
    }
    
You can find the specification of the respective methods and destinations [here](#destinations-and-methods).

## Destinations and methods

## Process IRIS Client data requests

You need to provide a json-rpc endpoint on your server. The exact endpoint can be configured in your EPS configuration file. 
    
    - name: main JSON-RPC client # creates outgoing JSONRPC connections to deliver and receive messages
        type: jsonrpc_client
        settings:
          endpoint: http://[your-host]:[your-port]/[your-endpoint]
          
To receive incoming DataRequests, you need to implement a method `createDataRequest` on your Endpoint. 

The method has to accept the following paramters:

createDataRequest parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Annotations |
| --- | --- | --- |    
| `_client` | Calling EPS details |  
| `dataRequest` | DataRequest details |

_client object:

| Parameter | Description | Annotations |
| --- | --- | --- |    
| `name` | Calling eps | You will use this name to reach the endpoint for data submissions  

dataRequest object:

| Parameter | Description | Annotations |
| --- | --- | --- |    
| `start` | Start of requested time period | 
| `end` | End of requested time period | You will use this name to reach the endpoint for data submissions  
| `requestDetails` | Additional message (optional) | May contain additional information about the request   
| `dataAuthorizationToken` | Identifies the request to the health department | Used in submission to ensure that the data has been requested by the HD.   
| `connectionAuthorizationToken` | Identifies the connection to public proxy | Will be necessary in the future to be able to send submissions from the browser.
| `locationID` | Your location identifier | The identifier you used when creating the location.

Response:

| Parameter | Value | 
| --- | --- |  
| `_` | ``OK`` | 

The request can be saved and edited locally. The functions for transmitting the data to the health authorities are next on the roadmap.

## Send data submissions

There are two ways to submit data to IRIS. The two ways result from the two different types of data management. Apps that can provide data unencrypted in the backend can send data directly to IRIS via EPS from the backend. If the user data must first be decrypted by the operator or another authority in the browser, it can then be transmitted directly from the browser via end-to-end encryption.

### Send data from app backend

The data is sent to the custom EPS via JSON-RPC. The method name used is `[hdEndpoint].submitGuestList`. `[hdEnpoint]` corresponds to _client.name from the received DataRequest.

    {
        "requestId": "2edd34d6-bc7b-11eb-8529-0242ac130003",
        "guestList": 
            [
                {

                    "lastName": "Müller",

## Test your implementation

To test your implementation, visit [https://iris.staging.iris-gateway.de:9443](https://iris.staging.iris-gateway.de:9443) 

You can find the password and access data in the slack channel.

There you should find your pushed locations in the search when you start a new event tracking. If you send the request, you should receive a data request.
